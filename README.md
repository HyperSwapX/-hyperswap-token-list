# HyperSwap Token List

This repository is dedicated to the list of tokens registered on the HyperSwap exchange. It serves as the central place where tokens can be added, allowing them to be displayed and used on the DApp, including showing their logos.

## How to Add a Token

If you want to add a new token to the list, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HyperSwapX/hyperswap-token-list.git
   cd hyperswap-token-list
   ```
2. Modify the `tokens.json` File
   Open the `tokens.json` file in a text editor and add your token's information. Make sure to follow the existing format in the file.
3. Submit a Pull Request
   After adding your token, commit your changes and push them to your forked repository. Then, create a pull request to the main branch of the `hyperswap-token-list` repository.
   ```bash
   git add tokens.json
   git commit -m "feat: add [Your Token Name] to tokens list"
   git push origin main
   ```
   Go to the repository on GitHub and click on "New Pull Request" to submit your changes.

## Pull Request Review

All pull requests will be reviewed and processed to ensure they follow the required format and standards. Once approved, your token will be added to the list on the DApp, making it available for users to interact with.

By adding your token to this list, it will be registered on the HyperSwap exchange, and its logo will be displayed alongside other tokens, enhancing its visibility.

We appreciate your contributions!
